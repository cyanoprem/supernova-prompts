For improving funnel metrics (Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Renewal → Referral):



JTBD + ODI

If your goal is to produce ideas that measurably move funnel metrics, JTBD+ODI is the most reliable, repeatable way to generate high-quality ideas (and not just a long list). Why it works:
	•	Metric-first: You target one bottleneck (e.g., Activation rate) and surface the underserved outcomes that block it.
	•	Idea generation is built-in: Each underserved outcome becomes a springboard for multiple solution ideas.
	•	Evidence-based: You quantify importance & satisfaction to rank opportunity areas before ideating.
	•	Plays across the funnel: Works for messaging (Acquisition), first-run experience (Activation), habit loops (Retention), value realization (Renewal), and shareability (Referral).

How to run JTBD+ODI in 7–10 days
	1.	Pick a single target metric & segment
	•	e.g., Improve Activation (first key action completion) for new self-serve SMB sign-ups.
	2.	Map the job & job steps
	•	Interview 8–12 target users about what they’re trying to accomplish (not features).
	•	Draft steps (e.g., discover → evaluate → set up → first success → repeat → expand).
	3.	Elicit outcome statements (the ODI way)
	•	Write needs as measurable improvements, e.g., “Minimize the time to import existing data,” “Reduce the likelihood of setup errors,” “Increase confidence the trial won’t lose work.”
	4.	Quantify (lightweight survey)
	•	Ask the segment to rate each outcome’s Importance and Satisfaction (e.g., 1–10).
	•	Compute an opportunity score (e.g., higher when Importance is high and Satisfaction is low). Sort descending to find the most underserved outcomes.
	5.	Generate ideas against the top 5–8 outcomes
	•	For each outcome, run a 30-minute mini-SCAMPER to create 5–10 solution concepts each.
	•	Capture them in an Opportunity Solution Tree under the outcome.
	6.	Prioritize with RICE (or ICE)
	•	Score each idea on Reach, Impact (on the target metric), Confidence, Effort. Pick the top 3–5 for rapid tests.
	7.	Test & learn
	•	Write crisp hypotheses: “For new SMB sign-ups, if we auto-import data from X, Activation will rise from 32% → 40% within 14 days.”
	•	Ship smallest viable experiment, measure, iterate.

What this looks like across the funnel (examples)

Acquisition
Underserved outcome: “Increase confidence this tool fits my use case before sign-up.”
Ideas: interactive demo with sample data; “compare to alternatives” page; calculator that outputs tailored ROI.

Activation
Underserved outcome: “Reduce the time to first success.”
Ideas: single-click data import; opinionated defaults; inline checklist that auto-progresses; guardrails to prevent setup errors.

Retention
Underserved outcome: “Increase consistency of achieving the core job each week.”
Ideas: scheduled automations; “at-risk task” alerts; saved views that persist context; weekly progress digest.

Renewal
Underserved outcome: “Increase perceived value relative to cost at the moment of renewal.”
Ideas: renewal page that shows realized outcomes/ROI; usage thresholds with nudges; success manager video summary.

Referral
Underserved outcome: “Reduce the effort to share results with peers.”
Ideas: one-click shareable reports; lightweight invite flow that pre-configures collaborator roles; “refer & co-create” templates.

Minimal toolkit you can adopt immediately
	•	Framework: JTBD + ODI (for idea generation)
	•	Structure: Opportunity Solution Tree (to keep focus)
	•	Prioritization: RICE (to pick what to ship first)
	•	Metrics: AARRR/HEART (to define success and diagnostics)

Quick starter pack (copy/paste)

Outcome statement template (ODI-style)
“Minimize / Reduce / Increase the [metric you can measure] when [job step or context].”

Hypothesis template
“For [segment], if we [change], then [target metric] will move from X to Y within [time window], because [underserved outcome].”

RICE fields
Reach (users per period) · Impact (expected lift on target metric) · Confidence (%) · Effort (person-weeks).

When to choose something lighter

If you need speed over rigor this week: run a 90-minute ideation on your worst funnel stage using SCAMPER to generate options, then RICE to pick 3 to test. But for durable, repeatable wins tied to metrics, JTBD+ODI is my top pick.

If you want, I can share a 1-page worksheet (JTBD outcome capture, opportunity scoring, and a RICE backlog) you can use with your team.
