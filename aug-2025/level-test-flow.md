Placement Criteria: Accuracy and Time
	•	A1 (Beginner)
	•	Accuracy: May answer fewer than half of the MCQs correctly, and translation attempts often lack basic grammar or vocabulary.
	•	Time: Likely takes a long time to answer due to minimal familiarity with English.
	•	Typical Performance: Struggles with very basic sentences (e.g., Simple Present, common verbs).
	•	A2 (Elementary)
	•	Accuracy: Usually answers around half of the MCQs correctly. Demonstrates some correct usage of simple tenses in the translation.
	•	Time: Faster than A1, but still requires significant effort to form correct sentences.
	•	Typical Performance: Handles simple sentences but has trouble with perfect tenses and more complex sentences.
	•	B1 (Intermediate)
	•	Accuracy: Answers most MCQs correctly (6–8 out of 10). Translations are generally understandable, with some errors in complex grammar.
	•	Time: Reasonably quick but may pause on challenging grammar.
	•	Typical Performance: Comfortable with everyday topics (work, school, daily routines) and can manage moderate complexity (conditionals, perfect tenses).
	•	B2 (Upper Intermediate)
	•	Accuracy: Answers at least 8 or 9 out of 10 MCQs correctly. Translations show good control of grammar and vocabulary with fewer errors.
	•	Time: Fairly quick; can form sentences and use varied tenses with confidence.
	•	Typical Performance: Demonstrates an ability to discuss abstract ideas, hypothetical situations, and uses advanced structures (conditionals, perfect continuous tenses, etc.) with relative accuracy.
How to Use the Test
	1.	Give the user a set time limit (e.g., 10–15 minutes) to complete both the MCQs and the translations.
	2.	Check accuracy:
	•	MCQs: Tally the number of correct answers out of 10.
	•	Translations: Assess grammar, vocabulary, and overall clarity.
	3.	Combine time + accuracy to determine the user’s level according to the bands described above.
This structured approach helps identify whether learners are at A1, A2, B1, or B2, allowing you to place them in the appropriate track or design targeted lessons for their current abilities.
Below is a precise way to link (1) which MCQ questions correspond to each CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2), (2) the minimum score required, and (3) the time brackets you can use to place learners accurately. The idea is that both which questions they answer correctly and how many they answer correctly—within a certain time limit—helps you determine their level.
1. Question-to-Level Mapping
Each of the 10 MCQ questions corresponds roughly to a certain CEFR level or grammar point.
Question	Grammar Topic	Level Focus
Q1	Simple Present (e.g., “She goes…”)	A1
Q2	Simple Past (e.g., “I ate…”)	A1
Q3	Simple Future (e.g., “You will…”)	A2
Q4	Present Perfect (e.g., “I have been…”)	A2
Q5	Forming Questions (Can she…? Does she…?)	A2
Q6	Modal Verb for Ability (can)	A2
Q7	2nd Conditional (imaginary situations)	B1
Q8	Comparative Adjectives (more interesting)	B1
Q9	Prepositions (in, on, at, to, from)	B1
Q10	Past Perfect (had + past participle)	B2
2. Accuracy and Time Criteria
Below is a table showing exactly how many total correct answers (out of 10) and which key questions must be correct, in combination with the time taken, to determine the level.
Level	Min. Correct Answers	Must Correctly Answer…	Typical Time Used	Description
A1	0–4	At least Q1 or Q2	Over 12 minutes	Struggles with basic tenses; long time needed. May only get a few questions right, mostly the simplest ones.
A2	5–6	Q1, Q2 plus at least two from Q3–Q6	10–12 minutes	Manages basic present/past/future forms. Misses more complex or perfect tenses. Time is moderate but not very fast.
B1	7–8	All from Q1–Q6 and Q7, Q8, Q9 correct	7–10 minutes	Comfortable with conditionals, comparatives, modal usage. Shows good, but not perfect, control of grammar.
B2	9–10	All from Q1–Q9 plus Q10	Under 7 minutes	Quickly and accurately handles virtually all questions, including past perfect. Demonstrates strong command of grammar.
How This Works in Practice
	1.	Check the total correct answers (out of 10).
	2.	Verify the specific key questions needed for each band. For instance, a B1 candidate not only has 7–8 correct in total, but specifically has Q7, Q8, and Q9 correct.
	3.	Look at the time it took the learner to finish all 10 MCQs. If someone meets the accuracy threshold for B2 but spends 15 minutes doing so, they might still be borderline B1/B2. Conversely, if they get 8 correct in only 6 minutes, they might be on track for B2 but made some errors—so a borderline B1/B2 as well.
3. Putting It All Together
	1.	Score them on the 10 MCQs and note exactly which they answered correctly.
	2.	Time the test: Have a set method (e.g., an online timer or a strict 8–12-minute window).
	3.	Decide their level based on:
	•	Accuracy (the total correct + the specific key questions for each level).
	•	Speed (time bracket as listed in the table).
For example:
	•	A learner who gets 3 correct (e.g., Q1, Q2, and Q4) and takes 13 minutes is solidly A1.
	•	A learner who gets 6 correct including Q1, Q2, Q3, Q6 but misses Q7, Q8, Q9, and takes 11 minutes, is A2.
	•	A learner who gets 8 correct including Q7, Q8, Q9, and does it in 9 minutes, is B1.
	•	A learner who gets 9 or 10 correct including Q10 in 6 minutes or less is clearly B2.
This exact and precise method ensures you can map each test result to the appropriate CEFR level.
