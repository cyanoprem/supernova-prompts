# Metrics to Move: Pay Percentage Optimization

## Primary Goal
**Target Metric**: Pay Percentage  
**Current**: 13%  
**Target**: 20%  
**Gap**: +7 percentage points

## User Journey Funnel

### 1. App Installation → Login
- **Stage**: User acquisition and authentication
- **Focus**: Ensure smooth login experience

### 2. Login → Profile Creation
- **Stage**: User onboarding
- **Focus**: Complete profile setup for personalized experience

### 3. Profile Creation → Onboarding Form
- **Stage**: Initial user qualification
- **Focus**: Gather user preferences and learning goals

### 4. Onboarding Form → Premium Page
- **Stage**: Conversion point
- **Focus**: Present value proposition and payment options

## Conversion Analysis

### Current Pay Distribution
- **11-12%**: Pay during first model interaction (without exploring)
- **2%**: Pay after exploring the app
- **50%**: Explore the app (of total users)
- **2%**: Pay after exploration (of explorers)

### Key Insight
**Exploration-to-Pay Conversion Gap**: Only 2% of users who explore the app end up paying, despite 50% of total users exploring.

## Active Experiments

### 1. Free Trial Duration Experiments
**Variable**: Trial hours
- **Range**: 6 minutes to 3 days
- **Goal**: Find optimal trial length for conversion

### 2. Question Limit Experiments
**Variable**: Number of free questions
- **Goal**: Balance free value with conversion pressure

### 3. Premium Page Experiments
**Variables**:
- **Modal closing**: Different close mechanisms
- **Timer visibility**: Visible vs invisible timers
- **Language variations**: Multiple language versions
- **Content variations**: Testimonials, FAQ, etc.

## Optimization Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Exploration-to-Pay Conversion** (2% → Target: 8-10%)
   - Focus on users who explore but don't convert
   - Improve value demonstration during exploration

2. **Premium Page Optimization**
   - Test different value propositions
   - Optimize payment flow and friction points

### Medium Priority
3. **Free Trial Duration Optimization**
   - Find sweet spot between value demonstration and conversion urgency

4. **Question Limit Optimization**
   - Balance free usage with conversion triggers

### Low Priority
5. **First-Interaction Conversion** (11-12% → Target: 15%)
   - Already performing well, incremental improvements
